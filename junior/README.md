## Objectives

1. Build a small Rails project
2. Be able to create basic models, migrations, controllers, and views

## Instructions

For this mini project, you'll create a small Rails app. 
You must build a todo list:

- Any logged in user can add/edit/delete items
- Anonymous user can only visualize the list
- Must be able to add tags to the item
- The todo list should be filterable by tags
- Try to create the layout like the image below:

![Alt text](todo-sample.jpg?raw=true "Layout sample")


### Requirements
- Have at least 3 distinct models
- There should be at least one many-to-many relationship 
- Hit at least 1 API
- Create seed data 
- Write model tests 
- Push the project to a github respository

### Ultra Bonus
- Practice refactoring
- Make it pretty with Bootstrap or Materialize (look into the [Rails Asset Pipeline](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html))
- Deploy to Heroku
- Setup a build on github Actions
- Small commits and good commit messages
